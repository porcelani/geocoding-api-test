Geocoding Api Test
-------------------

Write a brief script/automation test that will effectively test the Google Geocoding API.
This program should test for any behavior, edge case or performance metric that you think
 is relevant to maintaining an validating the REST API.
You should expect that this program will be run after each deploy to ensure
the API is functioning properly in a production environment.
